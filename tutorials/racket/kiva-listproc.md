# "Real Data" : Microfinance Borrowers
**[Data: Lists of structures + Abstract List Functions]**

[Kiva.org](http://www.kiva.org/) connects individuals with microfinance opportunities in the developing world. Small business owners in developing countries request loans through Kiva. Kiva advertises these requests and lets individuals contribute small amounts to borrowers of their choice.

In these exercises, you will develop data definitions for key Kiva information and functions to process that information. You will also hook up your code to the Kiva website, so you can test your code on Kiva's actual data. This is a big part of what you'd need to do to write custom scripts or mashups based on Kiva's data.

For many of the tasks, using an appropriate abstract list processing function will get you through them quickly; but in every case, if you get stuck, you can always fall back to using the appropriate template for the parameters of your function.

## Data Definitions

1. Information about a borrower consists of their name, size of team, home country, type of business/activity, requested amount, and amount of the requested amount raised so far. Develop the data definition(s), examples, template(s), etc. that you will need for representing and processing information about a list of borrowers.

## Functions

2. Write a function `funds-needed` that consumes a list of borrowers and produces the total amount of money that these borrowers are still seeking (i.e., the sum of the amounts requested but not yet raised across all borrowers).
