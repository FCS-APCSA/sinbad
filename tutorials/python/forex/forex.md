# Tutorial: Currency Exchange

Welcome! This multi-stage tutorial provides an introduction to *Sinbad* - a Python library that enables you to incorporate data from live, online web services into your programs. We'll be using current and historical currency exchange rates to explore the use of *Sinbad*. The tutorial is divided into parts based on the programming concepts that are required for each step. With each part, we'll make a note of the Python concepts that you need to have covered to be able to follow along.

## Part 1 - Euro foreign exchange rates

### Required Python Concepts

### Downloading and Installing *Sinbad*

* Follow the instructions [here](../install/index.md).

### The Basics

To access any data source using *Sinbad*, there are three basic steps you carry out:

1. _Connect_ to the data source by URL or filename
2. _Load_ all the data
3. _Fetch_ elements of interest from the data

There are several steps that may be required for step 1, and there are a variety of ways that you can fetch elements from the data in step 3 - we'll cover these eventually.

### Finding the Data

To get started, we need some data to work with. We'll be using the data provided by the European Central Bank at this URL: http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/policy_and_exchange_rates/euro_reference_exchange_rates/html/index.en.html. 

Scroll about two-thirds of the way down the page and you should see a section of "Downloads" with a link for a CSV file. Right-click on that link and copy the link address. (If you want, you can also (left) click on it to download the file to your computer and open it in Excel.) The link should be something like: `http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref.zip?...`
