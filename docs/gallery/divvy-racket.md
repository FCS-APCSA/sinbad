## Historical Data

Available quarterly for the past few years.

### Code - Trip data

````
(define divvy-trips
  (sail-to "https://s3.amazonaws.com/divvy-data/tripdata/Divvy_Trips_2017_Q1Q2.zip"
           (format "csv")
           (option "file-entry" "Divvy_Trips_2017_Q1.csv")
           (sample 100)       ; or (load) for all the data
           (manifest)))

(define id (fetch-random divvy-trips "trip_id"))
(define start-time (fetch-random divvy-trips "start_time"))
(define user-type (fetch-random divvy-trips "usertype"))
(define duration (fetch-random divvy-trips "tripduration"))
; note: subsequent 'fetch-random's will fetch from the
;       *same* row of data as the first one (trip_id)

(string-append "Trip " (number->string id)
               " was made by a " user-type
               " at " start-time
               " and lasted for a duration of "
               (number->string (quotient duration 60)) " minutes")
````

### Output

    "Trip 13301347 was made by a Subscriber at 2/24/2017 08:32:06 and lasted for a duration of 5 minutes"


### Code - Station data

````
(define divvy-stns
  (sail-to "https://s3.amazonaws.com/divvy-data/tripdata/Divvy_Trips_2017_Q1Q2.zip"
           (format "csv")

           (load)
           (manifest)))

(define-struct stn (name cap city))

(fetch divvy-stns (make-stn "name" "dpcapacity" "city"))
````

### Output

````
